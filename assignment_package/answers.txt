To run benchmarks just run schedule-benchmarks.sh

Since the aim of the assignment is not to benchmark the google against amazon machines we decided to use following setup:

Google f1-micro
Disc type - HDD - 30 GB
Memory - 0,6 GB
CPU - Shared 0,2 virtual CPU
Zone - europe-west-3c
OS - centos-7
Virtualization - KVM (HW assisted)

Amazon t2.micro
Disc type - SSD - 50 GB
Memory - 1 GB
CPU - 1 virtual CPU - 3.3 GHz Intel Scalable Processor
Region - eu-central-1
OS - Amazon Linux
Virtualization - HVM (HW assisted)

Both machines use HW assisted virtualization



CPU benchmark questions: 

1. Look at linpack.sh and linpack.c and shortly describe how the benchmark works. 
Linpack benchmark consists of the number of 64-bit floating-point operations, generally additions and multiplications,, calculates FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second) of computers by running the programs that solves dense system of linear equations.The output of the script is in KFLOPS (Kilo Floating-Point Operations Per Second) and its prints the result to machine precision.

The ideal test technique for  the Linpack Benchmark is to run the same application on the systems being tested. Linpack benchmark reflect the performance of a dedicated system for solving a dense system of linear equations. Since the problem is very regular, the performance achieved is quite high, and the performance numbers give a good correction of peak performance.
2. Find out what the LINPACK benchmark measures (try Google). Would you expect paravirtualization to affect the LINPACK benchmark? Why? 
The LINPACK benchmark measures how fast a computer solves linear algebra calculations, LU decomposition and solving a system of linear equations. Its results are returned in number of floating point operations per second (FLOPS). 

As LINPACK Benchmark tasks involve only (most of the time) unprivileged instructions and are executed on the CPU of the system, we would not expect paravirtualization to affect the benchmark results until  the virtualized machine has dedicated access to the host's resources.

3. Look at your LINPACK measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?




Memory benchmark questions:

 1. Find out how the memsweep benchmark works by looking at the shell script and the C code. Would you expect virtualization to affect the memsweep benchmark? Why? 
Memsweep Benchmark measures memory access performance. This benchmark measures the required time to access (write and clean) buffer memory on various locations. The step width between the consecutive accesses is chosen such that a cache miss occurs and the data really has to be loaded from the memory. 

The memory pages should be already in RAM since buffer is allocated before the measurement starts. That is why paravirtualization should not affect memory benchmark.

In case of HVM/KVM we expect major effect on the memsweep benchmark because:
“Code violates locality assumption, lots of TLB misses - high cost O(n2), O(n) lookup cost” 

AWS - ARR_SIZE (8192 * 16384)
Google - ARR_SIZE (8096 * 4096)

We were testing different sizes of allocated heap and decided to use different values for AWS and google. For google 32 MB for AWS 128 MB. 

2. Look at your memsweep measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason?

Comparing the results between AWS and GCLOUD shows that the GCLOUD  machine is more than 2 times slower than the AWS machine even though the heap size is 4 times bigger for AWS. 




Disk benchmark questions: 

1. Look at the disk measurements. Are they consistent with your expectations? If not, what could be the reason? 
Our expectations based on the fact that in our case Google uses HDD and AWS uses SSD disk and based on the documentation we expect that in case of google - HDD -  sequential access will be faster than the random, whereas in case of amazon - SSD - there should not be any significant difference between random and sequential access. 

In our case disc measurements are consistent with our expectations.


2. Compare the results for the two operations (sequential, random). What are reasons for the differences?
 AWS EC2 instances probably run on SSD while gcloud on HDD, thus on EC2 there is almost no difference in sequential and random operations where as time the difference between sequential and random operation is visible on gcloud. 

“On a given volume configuration, certain I/O characteristics drive the performance behavior for your EBS volumes. SSD-backed volumes—General Purpose SSD (gp2) and Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)—deliver consistent performance whether an I/O operation is random or sequential.”

“ HDD-backed volumes—Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1)—deliver optimal performance only when I/O operations are large and sequential. ”
